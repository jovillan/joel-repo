currently if any secured page is access it will be redirected to login page
upon successful login the user will always be redirected to the home page
main functionality is authentication and authorization

SETUP:
the login page should be configured in xml file
the custom login page form should use the name username and password in username and password fields
xml config files dispatcher-servlet and spring-security should be added in web-inf and included in web xml
	
BUGS:
from logout page, press back, then forward to logout page again, it asks for form submission(this should not be the case)
solve naming exception
?if there are no user roles defined will it return null or empty on getRoles

FOR IMPROVEMENTS:
! should go back to the previously accessed page after successful login
!! add csrf
subject config
	-instead of using security config in java, dependency injection in subject could be used

USER CONFIG:
spring security ldap parameters
dispatcher servlet parameters
browser caching enable / disable
username case sensitive or not

TODO:		
store on an external file the user configurations
multi threading test
copy ldap implementation of cap ldap, for minimum config change
return exceptions instead of null
	return authentication exception - for now return null
			research how to properly implement an exception
	invoking hasRoles while the user has not been authenticated
