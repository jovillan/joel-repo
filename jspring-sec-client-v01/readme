currently if any secured page is access it will be redirected to login page
upon successful login the user will always be redirected to the home page

the login page should be configured in xml file
the custom login page form should use the name username and password in username and password fields
xml config files dispatcher-servlet and spring-security should be added in web-inf and included in web xml

added some comments

WED:
passing model attribute on redirect - ok
CLEAN CODE - ok
IMPLEMENT AUTHORIZATION - ok
	return authentication exception - for now return null
		reasearch how to properly implement an exception
-test
-copy ldap implementation of cap ldap, for minimum config change
-!create interceptor to prevent caching rather that letting the client side controller handle it
-?try to use dependency injection rather than using new in SecurityContextLogoutHandler at spring subject login
-tag them as release 1

?multi threading test

SUBJECT CONFIG
	-instead of using security config in java dependency injection in subject could be used

INTEGRATE TO SKILL PORTAL
upload to git after git training for better project management
externalize config files

TODO:		
store on an external file the user configurations

bugs:
from logout page, press back, then forward to logout page again, it asks for form submission(this should not be the case)
solve naming exception

for improvements:
! should go back to the previously accessed page after successful login
!! add csrf
